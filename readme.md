#Learning JavaScript in Minecraft Workshop Files

Kids love Minecraft, so instead of trying to teach them JS in the browser or in Node, why not do it in Minecraft where they can get immediate feedback in the game itself.

This repo is a group of files I use when teaching JavaScript inside Minecraft... demonstrating concepts (like event handling, loops, etc) or just some wow demos (like making a pyramid of animals in mid-air).

The *intent* is to update this periodically with new mods and write-ups on how to use them for teaching. For now, it's just my collection of files.

Because of the demise of CanaryMod, I had to port a few to Spigot. That is still in progress.

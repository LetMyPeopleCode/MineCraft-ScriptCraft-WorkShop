These are my class notes that I showed in my teaching workshop. I will expand upon them as time permits.

Quick Wow Demo
	
Let's make a mess
	jsp boom
	jsp boom 50
	jsp bighole

How to Reset Your World
	Let's clean up our mess
	
Variables
	numbers
		math operators - +=/*
	strings - echo()
		what needs to be in quotes (string contents, but not string names)
	addition / concatenation
	
Comparison operators
	= vs == vs ===
	! vs != vs !==
	&& || 

WEEK 2

DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL WORKSHOP FILES
	Go to github.com/yiddishninja
	Go into minecraft scriptcraft workshop
	download zip file
	unzip it into scriptcraft plugins folder
	js refresh();
	try jsp boom

Difference between js & jsp
	js requires mod power and executes any JS you give it
	jsp is for everyone and executes commands you've defined
	demo jsp boom
	we'll walk through the boom code later.

What is a function
	name, arguments, code
		example of using a function: dancefloor(5); 
		Show them dancefloor in drone/contrib
	
	calling
		function blankWorld(salutation) { echo( salutation + " World!" );}
		
	writing one in a file
		exports.greet = function( player ) {
			echo( player, 'Hi ' + player.name);
		}
		//NOTE HOW THIS ASSIGNS TO A VARIABLE

DID WE GET THIS FAR?
		
	use multiple arguments...
		exports.greet = function (salutation, player)...

Using if/then
	make an extension called greetif
	use greet as the base
	make var with myName = "GregBulmash"
	add if after the echo to tell me I'm cool
	add else after that to tell everyone else they are not
	demo if, else if

LOOP THE LOOP

	The while loop
		while(a true condition){
			perform this code		
		}
		
		exports.spiderDeath = function(player){
			var bob = doSpawn('spider', player.location);
			while(bob.getHealth > 0){
				echo("Bob's Health Is: " + bob.getHealth, player);
				bob.setHealth(bob.getHealth - .3);
			}
		}
		
		for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
			let's do this 10 times;
		}

Exploring the JavaDocs

https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/

If we look at the World interface, we see different methods. Look at all the different ways to invoke create explosion.

I've found the easiest way to get access to the world interface is through the self object. It contains a pointer to the world you're in and you can use that pointer to access the world's properties and methods.

/js self.world.createExplosion(self.location, 5, true)

The create explosion wants a location at which to create it. You can either give it explicit X, Y, and Z coordinates, or you can simply give it a location object by using self.location. Then you specify a power level. Then you can optionally specify whether the explosion should set blocks on fire.

dospawn to a horse. Look for leash holder and passenger setters.
